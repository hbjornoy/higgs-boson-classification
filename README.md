Machine learning CS-433 Project 1 - EPFL

This repository contains two parts, code and report. 

### Python 

This folder contains the following files: 
- run.py
- implementations.py
- cross_validation
- dataprocessing.py
- grad_loss.py
- proj1_helpers.py

### Jupyter notebook

This folder contains the following files: 
- basic_methods_implemented.ipynb
- step_by_step.ipynb

basic_methods_implemented.ipynb contains the implementations of the 6 basic functions, including optimization of hyperparameters to have a base comparison of the 6 methods. 

step_by_step.ipynb contains the step_by_step methodology for our final delivery on Keggle. This provides an overview of the methods used, including our process to find the optimal solution.
