# CS-433-Project-1
Machine learning CS-433 Project 1 - EPFL

This repository contains two parts, the code and report. 

## Python 

This folder contains the following files: 
- run.py
- implementations.py
- cross_validation
- dataprocessing.py
- grad_loss.py
- proj1_helpers.py


Of these files the following might need more explenation: 

#### cross_validation.py
- Contains the cross_validation code used by the two Jupyter Notebook files. 

#### dataprocessing.py 
- Contains methods for cleaning data, normalization of data, running PCA-analysis, calculating predictions etc.. 

#### grad_loss.py 
- Contains methods for computing gradients and loss functions. 


## Jupyter notebook

This folder contains the following files: 
- basic_methods_implemented.ipynb
- step_by_step.ipynb

Of these files the following might need more explenation: 

#### basic_methods_implemented.ipynb 
- Contains the implementations of the 6 basic functions, including optimization of hyperparameters to have a base comparison of the 6 methods. 

#### step_by_step.ipynb 
- Contains the step_by_step methodology for our final delivery on Keggle. This provides an overview of the methods used, including our process to find the optimal solution.
