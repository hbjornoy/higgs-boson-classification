# CS-433 Project 1 - powerpuffz
Machine learning CS-433 Project 1 - EPFL

This zip folder contains the code. The report is submitted separately. 


## Python  
- run.py
- implementations.py
- cross_validation.py
- dataprocessing.py
- grad_loss.py
- proj1_helpers.py


Of these files the following might need more explenation: 

#### cross_validation.py
- Contains the cross_validation code used by the two Jupyter Notebook files. 

#### dataprocessing.py 
- Contains methods for cleaning data, normalization of data, running PCA-analysis, calculating predictions etc.. 

#### grad_loss.py 
- Contains methods for computing gradients and loss functions. 


## Jupyter notebook
 
- basic_methods_implemented.ipynb
- step_by_step.ipynb

Of these files the following might need more explenation: 

#### basic_methods_implemented.ipynb 
- Contains the implementations of the 6 basic functions, including optimization of hyperparameters to have a base comparison of the 6 methods. 

#### step_by_step.ipynb 
- Contains the step_by_step methodology for our final delivery on Keggle. This provides an overview of the methods used, including our process to find the optimal solution. 

To run either of the notebooks, the datasets (train.dat and test.dat) must be in the same folder.
